# Writing uEnv.txt File from Scratch

[!] Note: Instead of booting from eMMC completed from the previous steps (Debian image; where there's only one partition, and `boot/` folder does not contain uImage), I've used microSD card (which contains Angstrom image) to boot to follow the lecture. 



## Introduction

* `boot` U-boot command will load the Linux kernel and execute it. `boot` simply runs the environment variable `bootcmd`. So, if you want to change the behavior of `boot`, you have to modify the commands stored in the environment variable `bootcmd`.

* U-boot always try to read the uEnv.txt from the boot source. If uEnv.txt is not found, it will use the default values of the enve variables.

  If you don't want U-boot to use default values, you need to enforce new values using uEnv.txt.

* U-boot's "load from memory device" commands:

  * `fatload` - Loads a binary file from FAT based file system into memory.
  * `load` - Loads a binary file from any file system.

  Examples:

  ```plain
  fatload usb 0:1 0x82000000 uImage
  fatload mmc 0:1 0x88000000 initramfs
  load mmc 0:1 0x88000000 uImage
  ```

  > * 1st arg - Interface (e.g., USB, MMC, etc.)
  >
  > * 2nd arg - Device#:Partition# (Device# can be checked by running something like `mmc list`.)
  >
  > * When the Linux image is properly flashed onto eMMC, eMMC partitions would look like:
  >
  >     <img src="./img/micro-sd-card-partitions.png" alt="micro-sd-card-partitions" width="600">
  >



* Our goal is to write our own uEnv.txt file from scratch and update the `bootcmd` so that when we run `boot` command from the U-boot prompt, it will refer to our custom uEnv.txt file while booting.

* Let's load the Linux binary image "uImage" from the second partition of the SD card into the DDR memory.

  ```plain
  => load mmc 0:2 0x82000000 /boot/uImage
  4002080 bytes read in 300 ms (12.7 MiB/s)
  ```
  
  > `/boot/uImage` since uImage file is located inside the directory `boot/` in the 2nd partition of SD card.
  
* Now, let's boot the Linux kernel image.

  This boot fails because the Linux Bootstrap Loader couldn't find the DTB. (This is why the Bootstrap Loader complains about the "Unrecognized machine ID ...". 

  ```plain
  => bootm 0x82000000

  ```

  > L13: The very last message from the U-boot. From this point on, the control is on the Linux Bootstrap Loader.

* To boot successfully, we need to let the Bootstrap Loader know where the correct DTB file is located.
