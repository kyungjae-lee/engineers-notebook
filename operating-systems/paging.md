# Paging



## Introduction

* Problems of the previously introduced memory management schemes:
  * **Fixed partitioning** - Inefficient memory utilization, internal fragmentation
  * **Dynamic partitioning** - Inefficient memory utilization, external fragmentation
* To overcome these limitations, **paging** technique was developed. 



## Paging

* In paging, 

  * Main memory is partitioned into equal fixed-size chunks (i.e., **frames**) that are relatively small.
  * Process is also divided into small fixed-size chunks (i.e., **pages**) of the <u>same size</u>.

  Simple paging is similar to fixed partitioning but is different in that its partitions are rather small (a program may occupy more than one partition) and these partitions need NOT be contiguous.

  [!] Note: Frame size = Page size

* Even if there are not sufficient unused contiguous frames to hold a process, a process can still be loaded as shown in the example below. The concept of logical address and the **page table** maintained by the OS together implement this feature.

* Along with the page tables, the OS also maintains a list of all the unoccupied frames in main memory that are available for pages.
* Unlike segmentation, paging is **invisible** to the programmer.

### Address Translation & Page Tables

* Page tables are maintained by the OS for each process.

* A page table contains the frame location for each page in the process. (Each entry: Page#-to-Frame# mapping)

* With paging, logical-to-physical address translation is still done by processor hardware. So, the processor must know how to access the page table of the current process.

  Logical address (page number, offset) $\to$ **Page table** $\to$ Physical address (frame number, offset)
