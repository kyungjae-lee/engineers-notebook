# File Management



## Overview

* From a user's point of view, the file system is a very visible and important part of an operating system.
* Files have desirable properties:
  * Permanence
  * Shareable between processors
  * Sharing permissions can be configurable
  * Structure and convenience for certain applications



## Common File Structures

* Stream
  * This is the simple text file we are used to programming with.
  * You start reading, byte-by-byte from the beginning to the end.
  * Sequential access - You can move forward or backward a certain number of bytes (file seeks).
  * No formal structure other than bytes.
* Records
  * A file is composed of multiple records. Records have fields, like objects.
  * You can read/write one record at a time.
  * Sequential access, one record at a time in sequence.
  * Some record based systems support indexing where you can move directly to an indexed record.
* Database
  * Collection of files storing record structures.
  * Often enterprise level databases manage their own file systems independently of the operating system.



## File System Support

* An operating system will provide system operations (library calls) to access the features of each file structure it supports.
* The file management system of the operating system is the gateway between your processes and the files the OS manages.
* Goals:
  * Meet user storage requirements
  * Guarantee that files are not corrupted
  * Optimize performance of file access
  * Provide standard I/O interfaces to the user processes for working with files
  * Provide security for multi-user systems



## Elements of File Management

## File System Architecture (Lowest to Highest Level)

* Device Drivers

  * Reside at the lowest level
  * Communicate directly with peripheral devices and controllers
  * Responsible for starting I/O on a particular device
  * For file systems, typical devices are tape drives, disks, etc.
  * Device drivers are either part of the operating system or very tightly coupled to it.

* Basic File System (Physical I/O level)

  * Deals with blocks of data that are exchanged between a disk or tape drive and the system.
  * Concerned with placement of blocks onto the storage media.
  * Considered part of the OS.

* Basic I/O Supervisor

  * Initiates/terminates I/O on behalf of processes.
  * Maintains control structures to deal with devices, file statuses, and queues for scheduling.
  * Selects device on which file I/O will be performed.
  * Manages I/O buffers
  * Considered part of the OS

* Logical I/O Layer

  * Enables applications to access the concept of logical files instead of programs having to deal with the block structure of the actual hardware device.
  * IE - You read and write lines from a file, not blocks (usually)
  * Maintains basic information about files (size, access data, location, name, directories)

* Access Methods: API

  * Layer closest to user programs
  * Provides a programming interface to the file system (operating system function libraries provided by your OS but also used by high level languages to interact with files)
    * OPEN, CLOSE, CREATE, PRINTF, etc.

  High level programming languages usually wrap these OS specific API calls so that your program can be OS independent. For example: C implements `printf()` for you to use to format your output. The internal code for `printf()` will call the `write()` operation for whatever OS your compiler is supporting to send those characters to a file.



## File Management

* User applications are concerned with records and streams and the logical concept of a *single* file.
* But, I/O is done at a lower level, on a block bases.
* i.e., A physical file is composed fo a sequence of physical blocks on a device.
* File management requires the ability to 
  * Allocate files to free blocks in secondary storage
  * Manage the free storage
  * Manage the growth of a file's size
* File systems also have to manage information about each file stored on the device. That information is stored in some of the blocks on the physical device and is also permanent. If the OS is shut down, you don't lose track of the files on your disk!



## Secondary Storage Management

There 2 basic strategies for file storage allocation.

1. Variable sized, contiguous portions
   * Storing a file in a single or very few large contiguous portions allows for dynamic partitioning of the storage system, and better retrieval performance (since all in same area)
   * Can use best fit, worst fit, etc. just like memory partitions. Suffers from fragmentation!
2. Block oriented
   * Small, fixed-size partitions
   * Flexible, eliminates external fragmentation
   * Allocated only the blocks as needed



## Fixed Block Size Allocation

1. Contiguous Allocation
   * A single, contiguous set of blocks is allocated at creation.
   * Requires file size up-front, how can files grow in size?
   * Simple for file system to keep up with. A file table entry only needs a start block address and a size.
   * Best for sequential access processing (tape drive)
   * External fragmentation - as files are deleted, leaves contiguous gaps of varying sizes.
   * Compaction - Process of reallocating contiguous files to one end of storage and move free storage to other side.
2. Chained Allocation
   * Not contiguous
   * The file table keeps track of the first block assigned to a file.
   * Each block contains a pointer to the next allocated block.
   * No external fragmentation
   * Files can grow and shrink in size, easily.
   * Advantage - A corrupted file system can be reconstructed by following the chain links to rebuild the list of blocks used by files and find the free blocks in the system.
3. Hierarchical Allocation



## UNIX/LINUX Inode Strategy

* Linux uses a block oriented strategy.

* A file system is created with a table containing records called **inodes**.

* Each inode in the file system records information about a single file.

* The number of inodes you initialize the volume with is the maximum number of files you can create, no matter how much storage is free.

* A directory in Linux is just a file with a list of file inodes identifiers in it.

* An inode is a data structure of a fixed size, generally 128 to 256 bytes depending on the word-size of your system.

* The contents of an inode:

### The Block Pointers

* The block pointers in an inode store a block address from the file system device.
* Many files consume more than one block of storage space.
  * The number of blocks a file requires is dependent on the block size of the storage device.
  * For example a 2 KB file will need 2 blocks on a device whose block size is 1024 bytes.
* Direct block pointer 1 points to the 1^st^ block of the file, direct block pointer 2 points to th 2^nd^ block of the file, and so on.

### Indirect Block Pointers

* The indirect block pointers are used if a file takes up more than N blocks on disk.
* Single indirect pointer
  * Points to a block. That block has pointers to the actual blocks the file is using.
  * So, if a block is 1024 in size (with 4 byte words) then a single indirect block will store 256 block addresses.
  * 1 level of indirection.
* Double indirect pointer
  * This points to a block that has pointer to blocks containing block addresses.
  * 2 levels of indirection.
* Triple indirect pointer
  * 3 levels of indirection

## Exercise

### Problem

* Suppose your system has a block size of 1024 bytes (assume 4 byte words - a single word can hold the address of a single block on disk)
* Suppose your inode has 10 direct block pointers and the 3 indirect pointers
* How large of a file could your file system support using this configuration?

### Solution

* Referring to the table below, for each level of indirection stored in the inode table, there are a certain number of blocks that can be referenced at each level. So for example, the direct level of referencing can identify 10 blocks for a file (or 10 K bytes of storage space). For each level of indirection the number of blocks (and corresponding space) are given.

  | inode block pointer level | Number of blocks on disk that can be addressed | Number of bytes these blocks represent in storage |
  | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
  | Direct                    | 10                                             | 10 x 1K = 10K                                     |
  | Single indirect           | 256 (1K / 4 bytes per address)                 | 256 x 1K = 256K                                   |
  | Double indirect           | 256 x 256 = 64K                                | 64K x 1K = 64M                                    |
  | Triple indirect           | 256 x 256 x 256 = 16M                          | 16M x 1K = 16G                                    |

* Therefore, the largest file in this sytem can be 16G + 64M + 256K + 10K in size.





## How is Free Space Managed?

* A large disk $\to$ large number of blocks $\to$ larger size of a free block table
* It makes more sense to store free block list partially in memory, and page it in and out as needed.
* What happens if the file system crashes or powers down while the free block list is being changed? You could scan all of the information in the inode pointers to recreate the list of blocks that are unused.
