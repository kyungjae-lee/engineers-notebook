# Engineer's Notebook



Welcome!

My name is Kyungjae Lee. I'm an embedded software enthusiast, passionate about demystifying the inner workings of *low-level software* and *system software*. On this website, I share what I've learned through my studies, and showcase a variety of related projects aimed at further exploring these software domains.
