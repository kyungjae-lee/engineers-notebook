# Data Types & Variables



## Data Types

* Data type is used for declaring the type of a variable.
* In C programming language, data types determine the **type** and **size** of data associated with the variables.
* Before a variable can store any value, its type must first be defined.

* Representing real-world data:
  * Data as numbers (e.g., integers, real numbers)
  * Data as characters
  * Data as strings (i.e., collection of characters)



## Some Important C Data Types

### Integer Data types

* Used to represent whole numbers (i.e., integers)

  e.g., 10, 20, 30, etc.

* Integer data types (signed):

  * `char`
  * `short int` - also used as `short` (`int` is implied)
  * `int`
  * `long int` - also used as `long` (`int` is implied)
  * `long long int` - also used as `long long` (`int` is implied)

  Integer data types (unsigned)

  * `unsigned char`
  * `unsigned short int`
  * `unsigned int`
  * `unsigned long int`
  * `unsigned long long int`

### Float Data Types

* Used to represent real numbers

  e.g., 10, 24.5, 60.00001, etc.
