## General Terms

* **Phishing**

  The fraudulent practice of sending **emails or other messages** purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.

  A social engineering technique whereby attackers under disguise of a  legitimate request attempt to gain access to confidential information.

* **Smishing**

  The fraudulent practice of sending **text messages** purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.

  Social engineering technique

* **Vishing**

  The fraudulent practice of making phone calls or leaving **voice messages** purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as bank details and credit card numbers.

  The practice of using a telephone system to manipulate user into disclosing confidential information.

* **Spam**

  Any kind of unwanted, **unsolicited digital communication (e.g., advertising message)** that gets sent  out in bulk. Often spam is sent via email, but it can also be  distributed via text messages, phone calls, or social media.

* **SPIM (Spam Over Instant Messaging)** 

  Spam messages symptomatic of widely-used free **instant messaging** apps like Messenger, Whatsapp, Viber, Telegram, Skype and WeChat. These spam messages are usually commercial-type spam but can contain malware and spyware.

* **Spear phishing**

  The fraudulent practice of sending emails ostensibly from a known or trusted sender in order to induce **targeted individuals** to reveal confidential information.

* **Dumbster diving**

  A  practice of sifting through trash for discarded documents containing  sensitive data.  Found documents containing names and surnames of the  employees along with the information about positions held in the company and other data can be used to facilitate social engineering attacks.  Having the documents shredded or incinerated before disposal makes  dumpster diving less effective and mitigates the risk of social  engineering attacks.

  A type of social engineering cyberattack in which criminals **redirect**  internet users trying to reach a specific website to a different, fake  site. These “spoofed” (**fraudulent**) sites aim to **harvest** a victim’s personally  identifiable information (PII) and log-in credentials, such as  passwords, social security numbers, account numbers, and so on, or else  they attempt to install pharming malware on their computer. Pharmers  often target websites in the financial sector, including banks, online  payment platforms, or e-commerce sites, usually with identity theft as their ultimate objective.

* **Tailgating**

  Gaining unauthorized access to restricted areas by following another person

* **Elicitation** (꾀어내기, 끌어내기)

  Describes the use of  casual conversation to extract non-public information from people  without giving them the feeling they are being interrogated.

  A message warning the recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat. The message is usually a chain e-mail that tells the recipients to forward it to everyone they know, but it can also be in the form of a pop-up window

* **Watering hole attack**

  A watering hole attack is a targeted attack designed to compromise users within a specific industry or group of users by infecting **websites** they typically visit and luring them to a malicious site. The end goal is to infect the user's computer with malware and gain access to the organizations network.

* **URL hijacking (a.k.a. Typosquatting)**

  A practice  of registering misspelled domain name closely resembling other well  established and popular domain name in hopes of getting Internet traffic from users who would make errors while typing in the URL in their web  browsers.

* **Malware**

  Harmful programs used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive  information, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.

  An example of cryptomalware.

* **Cryptomalware**

  A form of malware that enables a threat actor to carry out cryptojacking activity. While the process used by hackers is essentially the same as compared  to that used by legitimate cryptominers, crypto-malware leverages  another user's devices and processing power to gain payment.

* **Trojan horse**

  A type of software that performs unwanted and harmful actions in  disguise of a legitimate and useful program. This type of malware may act like a legitimate program and have all the  expected functionalities, but apart from that it will also contain a  portion of malicious code that the user is unaware of.

  Resides only in RAM

* **C2 server**

  Command-and-control servers, also called C&C or C2, are used by attackers to maintain communications with compromised systems within a target network.

  C2 server controls botnets

  Sending and receiving commands

  Delivering and executing malware



## Social Engineering Principles

Social Engineering relies heavily on the six Principles of Influence  established by Robert Cialdini, a behavioral psychologist, and author of Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.

1. **Reciprocity** – People tend to return a favor, thus the pervasiveness of free samples in marketing.
2. **Commitment** and **Consistency** – If people commit, orally  or in writing, to an idea or goal, they are more likely to honor that  commitment because they have stated that that idea or goal fits their  self-image. Even if the original incentive or motivation is removed  after they have already agreed, they will continue to honor the  agreement.
3. **Social Proof** – People will do things that they see other people are doing.
4. **Authority** – People will tend to obey authority figures, even if they are asked to perform objectionable acts.
5. **Liking** – People are easily persuaded by other people whom they like.
6. **Scarcity** – Perceived scarcity will generate demand. For example, saying offers are available for a "limited time only" encourages sales.

Social Engineering attacks commonly involve:

- **Pretexting** - Masquerading as someone else
- **Baiting** - Enticing the victim with promises of something of value
- **Blackmail** - Threatening to reveal something that the target wishes to be kept secret
- **Quid Pro Quo (a variant of Baiting)** - Promising something to the victim in exchange for their help
