# Events (Triggers)



## What is an Event?

* Events are incidents or a stimulus by which a state machine can be triggered. Incidents are abstracted as events.
* In state machine events cause transitions (external or internal)
* An event usually has 2 components
  * Signal
  * One or more associated values parameters (optional)
