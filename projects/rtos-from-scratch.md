## Introduction

A real‐time operating system with board support package developed from scratch without using libraries on STM32‐Discovery board



## Objective

* Create from scratch the board support package necessary for RTOS implementation.
  * LED driver
  * USART driver
  * Delay function using hardware timer
  * User push button driver
* Understand the real-time operating systems concepts.
* Understand the internals of an RTOS.
* Understand how different types of scheduling algorithms are implemented.
* Understand the ARM Cortex-M architecture.
